|===
| Config Option
| Type
| Valid Values
| Default Value
| Description

| host
| string
| any
|
| Fully Qualified Solace Hostname with protocol and port number.

| vpn
| string
| any
|
| Solace VPN name.

| username
| String
| any
|
| Solace Client Username.

| password
| string
| any
|
| Solace Client Username password.

| connectRetries
| int
| (-1) or greater
| 0
| The number of times to attempt and retry a connection during initial connection setup. Zero means no automatic connection retries (that is, try once and give up). -1 means "retry forever".

| reconnectRetries[[reconnect-retries]]
| int
| (-1) or greater
| 3
| The number of times to attempt to reconnect. Zero means no automatic reconnection retries (that is, try once and give up). -1 means "retry forever".

| connectRetriesPerHost
| int
| (-1) or greater
| 0
| When using a host list for the HOST property, this property defines how many times to try to connect or reconnect to a single host before moving to the next host in the list. NOTE: This property works in conjunction with the connect and reconnect retries settings; it does not replace them. Valid values are >= -1. 0 means make a single connection attempt (that is, 0 retries). -1 means attempt an infinite number of reconnect retries (that is, the API only tries to connect or reconnect to first host listed.)

| reconnectRetryWaitInMillis
| int
| 0 - 60000
| 3000
| How much time in (MS) to wait between each attempt to connect or reconnect to a host. If a connect or reconnect attempt to host is not successful, the API waits for the amount of time set for reconnectRetryWaitInMillis, and then makes another connect or reconnect attempt.

| solace.apiProperties.<Property>
| any
| any
|
a| Any additional Solace Java API properties can be set through configuring solace.apiProperties.<Property> where <Property> is the name of the property as defined in the https://docs.solace.com/API-Developer-Online-Ref-Documentation/java/constant-values.html#com.solacesystems.jcsmp.JCSMPProperties[Solace Java API documentation for com.solacesystems.jcsmp.JCSMPProperties], for example:
[source,yaml]

----

| solace.oauth.client.access-token
| string
| absolute file path to token file
| empty
| Set this configuration, if rotating access token is present in file. In this case connector will read access token directly from file instead of sending request to OAuth Server. Please note <<solace-oAuth-client-refresh-interval, Solace OAuth Client Refresh Interval>> should be set to read access token from file at regular intervals.

| solace.oauth.client.auth-server-url
| string
| any
| empty
| Full representation of token endpoint to fetch access token.

| solace.oauth.client.client-id
| string
| any
| empty
| OAuth Client ID

| solace.oauth.client.credentials.client-secret
| string
| any
| empty
| OAuth Client Secret

| solace.oauth.client.auth-server.client-certificate.file
| string
| any
| empty
| Absolute path to X.509 client certificate file for TLS connections. Make sure file path is accessible by the connector.

| solace.oauth.client.auth-server.truststore.file
| string
| any
| empty
| Absolute path to trust store file for TLS connections. This property works in two ways

1. If JKS file is available in cluster configure absolute path so that connector will load the JKS file.

2. If solace.oauth.client.auth-server.client-certificate.file is configured simply provide a path(should include file name as well). The connector will load the client certificate to key store and saves to JKS file .

| solace.oauth.client.auth-server.truststore.password
| string
| any
| empty
| Password for JKS file. This property works in two ways

1. If JKS file is available in cluster provide the password to JKS file.

2. If solace.oauth.client.auth-server.client-certificate.file is configured simply provide a password which will be used to protect the JKS file created in above configuration option 2.

| solace.oauth.client.auth-server.ssl.validate-certificate
| boolean
| any
| true
| Boolean value to enable or disable ssl certificate validation. If set to false connector will send TLS request without any validation.

| solace.oauth.client.auth-server.tls.version
| string
| SSL, TLS, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
| TLSv1.2
| Indicate the type of SSL connection.

| solace.oauth.client.token.refresh.interval[[solace-oAuth-client-refresh-interval]]
| integer
| positive integer value
| 60
| Interval(Seconds) to fetch access token by the connector to avoid disconnection on token expiry. This value should be less than your token expiry time.

| solace.oauth.client.token.fetch.timeout
| integer
| positive integer value
| 100
| Connection timeout(MS) for access token request.

| topic
| string
| any
|
| Sets the topic that all rows will be published to Solace. This option overrides any topic column that may exist in the data.

| id
| string
| any
|
| Sets the message id to all the messages published to Solace. This option overrides any Id column that may exist in the data.

| batchSize
| int
| any
| 1
| Set number of messages to be processed in batch. This should be set to dataframe.count().

| includeHeaders
| boolean
| true or false
| false
| Set this value to true if message headers in the row need to be added to published message.
